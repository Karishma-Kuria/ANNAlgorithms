# Various state of art libraries for Approximate nearest neighbor search for data set
1: This repository contains colab for various algorithms using state of art library for Approximate Nearest Neighbour Search.<br />
2: The dataset used is from LightFM.<br />
3: All the Algorithms uses the state of art libraries like Faiss and Annoy.<br />
4: It also contains descriptive comments in each step to describe the process.<br />
5: For all the Algorithms, used in the colab I have calculated and printed the time taken by each algorithm to search for the nearest neighbours.<br/>
